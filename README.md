Another iteration of my timer available at this link:<br />
https://github.com/kseternus/timer<br />
<br />
The program now uses the GUI, allows users to set a countdown timer, start, pause, and reset the timer.<br />
It also includes a simple layout with buttons and labels to display the remaining time.<br />
Once the countdown has finished (the counter reaches 00:00:00), an alarm sound is played.<br />
